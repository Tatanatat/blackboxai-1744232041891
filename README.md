# Project Title: Channel Manager

## Project Overview
Channel Manager is a backend application designed to manage your channels effectively. This project leverages MongoDB Atlas for database management, allowing developers to easily create, access, and manage channels in a cloud-based setting. By following the setup guide and utilizing the provided features, users can seamlessly organize their channel-related data.

## Installation
To set up the Channel Manager locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd channel-manager
   ```

2. **Navigate to the server directory**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Setup MongoDB Atlas**:
   Follow the [MongoDB Atlas Setup Guide](MONGODB_ATLAS_SETUP_GUIDE.md) to create a MongoDB account, set up a cluster, and create a database user.

5. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `channel-manager/server` directory with the following content:
   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=your_connection_string_here
   PORT=5000
   ```
   Replace `your_connection_string_here` with the connection string obtained from your MongoDB Atlas setup.

6. **Start the server**:
   Run the server with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints at `http://localhost:5000`. Utilize tools like Postman or Curl to make requests to the API. Refer to the API documentation for available endpoints and usage examples.

## Features
- **Cloud-Based Data Storage**: Leverage MongoDB Atlas for secure, cloud-based database management.
- **User Management**: Create and manage users and their access rights.
- **Flexible API**: Seamlessly interact with your channels through a well-defined API.
- **Environment Configuration**: Customizable environment settings via a `.env` file.
